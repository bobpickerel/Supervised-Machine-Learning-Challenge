# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Challenge
 - The purpose of this excercise is to create, fit, and score models using logistic regression and random forests classifer.  My prediction is that the random forests classifer will  provide the better results as that form of classifier normally proves to be superior to random forests.  Random forests classifiers also tend to give higher rates as the number of explanatory variables increases in the dataset.  This dataset has 14 features would likely lean toward Random forests.
 - Final Results - while both models turned in scores overy .99, the logistic model was slightly better.
 
 0.9936545604622369 vs 0.9917457697069748
 
 The difference appeared to be that the logistic model got more of a bump from the standard scaler then did the random forests.
 
 It would be interesting to continue this comparison on an additional dataset.
